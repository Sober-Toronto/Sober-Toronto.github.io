<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>
We're All-Inclusive - No matter how you identify or what your relationship with alcohol/substances is, you are WELCOME. We support individuals of all backgrounds and identities. Any racism, homophobia, or transphobia will NOT be tolerated under any circumstance. Ever.
</p>

<p>
We're Considerate - Each individual member makes our group whole. Your words have power. Please be mindful of the way you speak about yourself and others. No need to censor yourself, but please remain open-minded for thoughtful discussion. We do NOT police anyone's definitions, for example "sobriety", "religious", "queer", etc.
</p>

<p>
We're Respectful - We won't all agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behavior. We all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration to become personal attacks. Disrespectful, hostile or abusive language is not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
We're a Safe Environment - Everyone is free to share as much or as little about themselves and their views as they are comfortable with. We ask that you only attend our virtual and in-person events while sober.
</p>

<p>
We're Diverse - Different perspectives on issues allow room for learning and growth. Be curious as to how and why each member has developed the viewpoints they hold. Our differences are our greatest strength, let’s never use them against each other.
</p>

<p>
We're Confidential - What is shared within the group is sacred. Each member of this group has a responsibility to each other NOT to discuss any information about anyone else without their permission first.
</p>

<p>
We're Supportive, but Not a Support Group - We are a social group first and foremost, primarily meant to discuss social issues personal to each of us. If you need more support than this group is built to provide, that’s okay! Please consider reaching out for professional help (a href="https://www.uhn.ca/PatientsFamilies/Health_Information/Health_Topics/Documents/Resources_for_Addictions.pdf">).
</p>

<p>
We're Sex Positive - We accept all forms of sex, sexuality, and gender expressions. We do not tolerate kink-shaming, slut-shaming, or relationship shaming. All lifestyles are welcome to be discussed here, shamelessly.
</p>

<p>
You Are NOT Alone! - If you ever feel that anything in the Code of Conduct has been broken, please contact us (sobertorontomeetup@gmail.com) immediately. All matters in regard to breaking the Code will be addressed promptly.
</p>

Have Fun & Enjoy Yourselves!
